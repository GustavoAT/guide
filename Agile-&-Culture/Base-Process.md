## Context
The PDCA cycle, also known as the Deming or Shewhart cycle, is a systematic approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement.
It consists of four steps: Plan, Do, Check, and Act (PDCA).

## Cycle
1. **Plan:** This step involves identifying and defining the problem, setting goals and objectives, and developing a plan to achieve them.
This involves gathering data and analyzing it to understand the current situation and identify opportunities for improvement.
2. **Do:** In this step, the plan is executed, and the proposed changes are implemented. This is the phase where the plan is put into action.
3. **Check:** The third step is to check the results of the implementation to see if it has achieved the desired outcome.
This step involves measuring and monitoring progress, and comparing it to the goals and objectives set in the planning stage.
4. **Act:** Based on the results obtained in the check step, it is determined if the plan was successful and if the desired outcome has been achieved.
If it has, the process is continued. If not, the process is revised and improved, and the cycle is repeated until the desired outcome is achieved.

The PDCA cycle is a repetitive process, and it is not a one-time event, it is meant to be used continuously to improve the process and achieve the desired results.
